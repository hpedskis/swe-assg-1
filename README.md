The article I chose for this assignment is an article detailing the emerging trends in software development in 2018, following a survey administered by Coleman Parkes in 2017. The main finding of the survey was that interest is shifting from industry standards to "pride in workmanship" as well as software engineering quality. I found this part interesting because it touches on something we talked about in class, one of the flaws of the Waterfall methodology for software engineering, which is the trend to focus on speed rather than quality. More specifically, the idea that people avoid changes once a project has been specified, even when known flaws are discovered which leads to poor quality software.

The article I chose for this assignment is an article detailing the emerging trends in software development in 2018, following a survey administered by Coleman Parkes in 2017. The main finding of the survey was that interest is shifting from industry standards to "pride in workmanship" as well as software engineering quality. I found this part interesting because it touches on something we talked about in class, one of the flaws of the Waterfall methodology for software engineering, which is the trend to focus on speed rather than quality. More specifically, the idea that people avoid changes once a project has been specified, even when known flaws are discovered which leads to poor quality software.

### Ryan:

> The fact that only one third of developers were graded on the quality of their software eingeering is ridiculus. In that case, it's not hard to see why pride in worksmanship would go down in the long run, because they won't get hit for being lazy. It's funny to think that app failures and security breaches don't directly impact software developers, it almost reinforces a sense of detachment. It is just as strange to think that penalizing developers won't hurt inexperienced developers' sense of pride in their workmanship, which the survey cites as leading to high-quality software.
